    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a well-established mathematical technique for reducing the dimensionality of data, while keeping as much variation as possible.\n",

    "PCA is an unsupervised method, meaning that no information about groups is used in the dimension reduction. This means that PCA shows a visual representation of the dominant patterns in a data set.\n",
